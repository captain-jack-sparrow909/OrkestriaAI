Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` when an Appwrite project is ready to

## Appwrite foundation

The foundation is declared in `appwrite/schema.mjs` and includes eight TablesDB
tables, three private Storage buckets, and the `orchestrator` Function.

After adding an Appwrite project endpoint, project ID, and scoped server API key:

```bash
npm run appwrite:provision
```

The Appwrite Function source lives in `functions/orchestrator`. The hosted
preview uses platform-managed sign-in; workspace authorization and all durable
records are designed to be enforced by Appwrite.
