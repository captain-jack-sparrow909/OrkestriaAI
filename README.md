# OrkestriaAI

OrkestriaAI is a trusted AI operations control plane for browser work,
automation, DevOps, cloud cost, and security.

This repository contains the product website, protected command center, and
Appwrite foundation for identity-aware workspaces, approvals, audit events,
files, and background jobs.

## Product suite

- **Vela** — autonomous browser agent
- **Loom** — AI workflow builder
- **Tempo** — AI DevOps assistant
- **Helio** — AI cloud cost optimizer
- **Aegis** — AI security review assistant

The full product, platform, Appwrite data model, and delivery roadmap are
documented in [docs/PRODUCT_BLUEPRINT.md](docs/PRODUCT_BLUEPRINT.md).

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Validation

```bash
npm run build
npm test
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` when an Appwrite project is ready to
connect.

## Appwrite foundation

The foundation is declared in `appwrite/schema.mjs` and includes twenty-nine TablesDB
tables, three private Storage buckets, and the `orchestrator` Function.

After adding an Appwrite project endpoint, project ID, and scoped server API key:

```bash
npm run appwrite:provision
npm run appwrite:deploy-function
```

The Appwrite Function source lives in `functions/orchestrator`. The hosted
preview uses platform-managed sign-in; workspace authorization and all durable
records are designed to be enforced by Appwrite.

## AI provider

The orchestrator uses DeepSeek V4 Flash through its OpenAI-compatible Chat
Completions API. The model only produces bounded, validated plans. OrkestriaAI
policy—not model output—decides when human approval is mandatory.

The function accepts `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` or the legacy local spelling
`DEEP_SEEK_API_KEY`, and uses `deepseek-v4-flash` by default.

## Current phase

Phase 8 adds **Launchroom**, the Pilot & GA Command Center. It durably tracks
pilot membership and consent truth, predefined production action envelopes,
Function-backed exercises, support coverage, launch evidence, and owner-recorded
go/hold decisions. External invitations, provider actions, backup
acknowledgements, and recovery restores are never inferred from local records.
A go decision is rejected while any launch blocker remains.

**Next phase:** Phase 9 — General Availability & Scale Operations: verified
provider executors, real pilot telemetry, incident response exercises, billing
controls, customer support workflows, and measured SLO-based expansion.
